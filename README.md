# Mood Map Privacy policy
Each time you take a mood log, it is stored in an SQlite Database on the phone. 
The app data is all kept locally on the device. This data is deleted when you uninstall the app. No data is shared with third party when you log a mood since it is kept locally on the device. 

## Advanced Settings
The "Advanced settings" allow you to export data, email data and import data. 
It is still in beta stages.
These settings are turned off by default since the data is not encrypted which is a security risk. 

**It is advised to not log any identifiable information when creating a mood log.** 

In the next update encryption of the database backup and emailing will have encryption. It was felt that the features are still useful right now and are acceptable to use if the user doesn't write identifiable information.

 - Exported backup is kept on internal memory even after uninstalling app
 - The option to email csv is handled by third party apps on the device like gmail / WhatsApp to share information.
